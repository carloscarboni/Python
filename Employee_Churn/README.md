### Objective:
Analyze employee data to predict the likelihood of employees leaving the company (churn) using machine learning models.

### Description:
The script connects to a Google BigQuery dataset containing employee information. It uses the pycaret library to set up, train, and evaluate a classification model, specifically focusing on the "Quit_the_Company" target variable. The model predicts churn probabilities for current employees and generates insights on feature importance.

### Skills:
- Data retrieval from Google BigQuery
- Machine learning model setup and evaluation using pycaret
- Feature importance analysis
- Writing predictions and feature tables back to BigQuery.

### Technology:
- Python (libraries: google.cloud.bigquery, pycaret, pandas)
- Google BigQuery for data storage and retrieval
- Machine learning techniques for classification (random forest model).

### Results:
- Trained and evaluated a machine learning model to predict employee churn.
- Generated predictions for new employees and stored the results in BigQuery.
- Created a feature importance table to identify key factors influencing employee churn.
