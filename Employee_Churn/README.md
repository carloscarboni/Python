### Objective:
Analyze employee data to predict the likelihood of employees leaving the company (churn) using machine learning models and visualize the results in a dashboard.

### Description:
The script connects to a Google BigQuery dataset containing employee information. It uses the pycaret library to set up, train, and evaluate a classification model, specifically focusing on the "Quit_the_Company" target variable. Predictions and feature importance insights are generated, and a graphical report is created to present the results using Looker Studio.

### Skills:
- Data retrieval from Google BigQuery
- Machine learning model setup and evaluation using pycaret
- Feature importance analysis
- Writing predictions and feature tables back to BigQuery
- Data visualization and reporting with Looker Studio.

### Technology:
- Python (libraries: google.cloud.bigquery, pycaret, pandas)
- Google BigQuery for data storage and retrieval
- Machine learning techniques for classification (random forest model)
- Looker Studio for data visualization and reporting.

### Results:
- Trained and evaluated a machine learning model to predict employee churn.
- Generated predictions for new employees and stored the results in BigQuery.
- Created a feature importance table to identify key factors influencing employee churn.
- Delivered a graphical report of the results in Looker Studio for easy interpretation by stakeholders.
