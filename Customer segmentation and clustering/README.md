### Objective:
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and cluster mall customers to identify patterns in their annual income, age, and spending scores using clustering techniques.

### Description:
The script analyzes a dataset named Mall_Customers.csv, which contains demographic and behavioral data of customers. It includes univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses, followed by the application of KMeans clustering algorithms to identify homogeneous groups based on key characteristics.

### Skills:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization using seaborn and matplotlib
- Clustering with KMeans
- Data normalization and elbow graph creation to determine the optimal number of clusters.

### Technology:
- Python (libraries: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn)
- Clustering algorithms (KMeans)
- Categorical data processing and feature scaling.

### Results:
- Identification of patterns in customer income and spending behavior.
- Grouping of customers into different clusters based on demographic and behavioral characteristics.
- Visual insights into distributions of gender, income, and spending behavior for each cluster.
